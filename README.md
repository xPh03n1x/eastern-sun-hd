# Eastern Sun HD
Eastern Sun mod ported for Diablo 2 1.13c

The Eastern Sun mod was quite fun back in the day. Alas, the official support for the mod ended with Diablo version 1.10f. I modified the files to be compatible with 1.13c and tried to simplify the installation process as much as possible.

**The mod performs well in Single Player and in TCP/IP games.** I have fixed any crashes I stumbled upon.

**Open Battle.net servers with PvPGN and D2GS act unexpectedly**, I don't have the time and nerves to attempt fixing all the issues there.

The credits for the mod and its resources go to their respective authors.


# Modifications

- In the original mod various items are set to be available only on Ladder servers. In this mod **ALL items** can be obtained in Single Player, TCP/IP, and Open Battle.Net games.

- Large number of items were set to be obtainable only via Gamble. This kills the logic behind adventuring. **ALL items** should now be available for finding in the open world.


# Plugin Support

As part of the mod I've included the following plugins:

- SlashDiablo's HD plugin
- PlugY
- BaseMod 
- Project Diablo 2's version of SlashDiablo's BH Maphack (*+LootFilter support  -MapHack*)

Credits for these plugins go to their respective authors. I have added small modifications to them to make them compatible with Eastern Sun

2. Download the latest version (1.14d) from Blizzard's website
